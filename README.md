IU Website Branding
===========

Repository for Omeka plugin for Indiana University Branding.

You need to change the name of the directory to just IuWebsite and upload to your plugins directory. 

If you have a previous version installed, uninstall and delete the directory. Then copy the new IuWebsite to the plugins directory.

In addition, each theme in Omeka handles its footer differently so I have noticed that in some cases it works fine and in others you will need to tweak.

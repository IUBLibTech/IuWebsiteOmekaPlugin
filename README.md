IU Website Branding
===========

Repository for Omeka plugin for Indiana University Branding.

Unzip the file and then change the name of the directory to just IuWebsite and upload to your plugins directory. 

If you have a previous version installed, uninstall and delete the directory. Then copy the new IuWebsite to the plugins directory.

In addition, each theme in Omeka handles its footer differently so in some cases it works fine and in others you will need to tweak.
